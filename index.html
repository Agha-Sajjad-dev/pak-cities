        Pakistan, populous multiethnic country of South Asia. Having a
        predominately Indo-Iranian speaking population, Pakistan has
        historically and culturally been associated with its neighbours Iran,
        Afghanistan, and India. Since Pakistan and India achieved independence
        in 1947, Pakistan has been distinguished from its larger southeastern
        neighbour by its overwhelmingly Muslim population (as opposed to the
        predominance of Hindus in India). Pakistan has struggled throughout its
        existence to attain political stability and sustained social
        development. Its capital is Islamabad, in the foothills of the Himalayas
        in the northern part of the country, and its largest city is Karachi, in
        the south on the coast of the Arabian Sea.

        Pakistan encompasses a rich diversity of landscapes, starting in the
        northwest, from the soaring Pamirs and the Karakoram Range through a
        maze of mountain ranges, a complex of valleys, and inhospitable
        plateaus, down to the remarkably even surface of the fertile Indus River
        plain, which drains southward into the Arabian Sea. It contains a
        section of the ancient Silk Road and the Khyber Pass, the famous
        passageway that has brought outside influences into the otherwise
        isolated subcontinent. Lofty peaks such as K2 and Nanga Parbat, in the
        Pakistani-administered region of Kashmir, present a challenging lure to
        mountain climbers. Along the Indus River, the artery of the country, the
        ancient site of Mohenjo-daro marks one of the cradles of civilization.
